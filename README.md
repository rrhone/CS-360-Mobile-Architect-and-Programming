For this project, I created an Inventory Tracking App aimed at improving warehouse management by simplifying the processes of adding, removing, and adjusting stock levels. The app also includes notifications to alert users when inventory is running low. The main objective was to make it easier for users to monitor and manage inventory efficiently. The app features several key screens: a login page for user authentication, an inventory grid to display items, an add/remove screen for managing stock, and a detailed view for editing item details. For the development process, I prioritized writing organized and modular code and employed the Room database for effective inventory management. Testing was conducted extensively using the Android Emulator to identify and resolve any issues, which was crucial for ensuring the app's functionality. I faced some challenges with emulator performance which slowed down my apps development procecss. Overall, I successfully demonstrated my skills in developing user-friendly inventory management features and effective app design.
